# Australian Federal Budget Allocations Data Visualization

This project, conducted in R Studio, focuses on analyzing and visualizing changes in Australian federal budget allocations to states over five financial years.
The impact of inflation on these changes is also explored.
The messages conveyed by the visualizations can be valuable for a state MP when advocating for increased funding from the federal government for the state or certain sectors.
